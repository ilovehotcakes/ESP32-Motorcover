/**
  motor_settings.h - Specific hardware settings for the stepper driver and motor
  Author: Jason Chen

  A file that includes the hardware settings for stepper driver (BTT TMC2209 V1.2)
  and stepper motor (NEMA 11).

  To use this file:
  - Replace the connections from ESP32 to TMC2209 (mainly EN_PIN, STEP_PIN, DIR_PIN)
  - If you don't plan on using stallguard, comment out DIAG_PIN and RXD2
  - Check and modify stepper motor specifications. I use a NEMA11 with a 5.18 planetary
    gearbox because that gives me enough torque to move the shades while being small
    enough to fit inside the top compartment.
