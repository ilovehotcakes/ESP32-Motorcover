 secrets_example.h - A example of a secret.h file
  Author: Jason Chen
 
 For security reaons, WiFi and MQTT credentials are in the actual secrets.h
 file which isn't uploaded onto GitHub. It is also a place that is easy to
 fill in all the credentials at once instead of digging through main.

 To use this file:
  - Rename the file to "secrets.h"
  - Uncomment the relevant fields and fillout the information
